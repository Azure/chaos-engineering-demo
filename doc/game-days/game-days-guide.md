# Game Days Guide

Welcome to the Game Days Guide! This document provides an overview of running game days using chaos experiments. Game days are designed to help teams improve their resilience and response to unexpected issues in a controlled environment. Below are three scenarios for running game days, each with a unique approach to chaos engineering.

## Scenario 1: Monitoring and Recovery

In this scenario, multiple teams participate in a game day event where they must monitor and resolve issues in their assigned environments. Coaches will run chaos experiments against the team environments, and teams will score points based on how effectively they react to and resolve these issues.

## Scenario 2: Red Team vs Blue Team

In this scenario, teams are split into two groups: the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Red Team is responsible for creating chaos experiments on an environment, while the Blue Team must react to and resolve the issues caused by these experiments.

## Scenario 3: Resilience Improvement Challenge

In this scenario, teams are given a base environment and a set amount of time to improve its architecture to make it more resilient. At the end of the session, a series of load tests and chaos experiments will be run, and teams will be scored based on the resilience of their improved architecture.
